- [Environment-Model](https://github.com/CommonRoad/environment-model): C++ representation of CommonRoad scenarios with a Python interface. 
- [CommonRoad Scenario Designer](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-scenario-designer): Toolbox for Map Conversion and Scenario Creation for Autonomous Vehicles. 
- [CommonRoad CARLA-Interface](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-carla-interface): Interface between CommonRoad and the traffic simulator CARLA. 
- [CommonRoad Prediction](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-prediction): A collection and interface for prediction algorithms.
- [CommonRoad-all](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-all): Meta-package which automatically installs all CommonRoad tools currently released on PyPi.
- [CommonRoad Reactive Planner](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-reactive-planner): A sampling-based motion planner for autonomous vehicles using quintic polynomials in a Frenet frame.
- [Safe ACC](https://github.com/CommonRoad/safe-acc): Provably-correct and comfortable adaptive cruise control.
- [ACC Falsification](https://github.com/CommonRoad/safety-falsification-acc): Computationally efficient safety falsification of adaptive cruise control systems.
